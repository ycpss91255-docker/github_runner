# Deploying the scale-set listener under systemd (#108/#109)

Package and supervise the [scale-set listener](../listener/) as a host binary
under systemd (option a, [ADR-0001](../doc/adr/0001-ephemeral-jit-runners.md)).
The host needs **no Go toolchain**: the binary is built inside a golang
container (#108) and only the static binary plus its sibling shell scripts are
installed.

## 1. Build & install the binary (#108)

```sh
# Build the static binary inside a pinned golang container:
make build-listener                 # -> bin/scaleset-listener

# Install binary + provision-job.sh + reap.sh + lib/ under PREFIX:
sudo make install-listener PREFIX=/opt/github-runner-listener
```

This lays down a self-contained tree the listener shells out against:

```
/opt/github-runner-listener/
├── bin/scaleset-listener           # the static binary systemd runs
├── listener/provision-job.sh       # per-job container entrypoint
├── listener/reap.sh                # orphan-sweep entrypoint
└── lib/*.sh                         # the bash seams those scripts source
```

## 2. Create the unprivileged service user

The unit runs as a dedicated non-root user (acceptance: never root). It must be
able to reach the rootless container engine (rootless podman session, or
membership in the `docker` group):

```sh
sudo useradd --system --create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin ci-runner
# If using rootful docker, also: sudo usermod -aG docker ci-runner
```

## 3. Provide the token via an EnvironmentFile (mode 0600) (#109)

The scale-set admin token is **never** baked into the unit, passed on the
command line, or logged — it is read from a root-only EnvironmentFile:

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/github-runner-listener
sudo install -m 0600 deploy/scaleset-listener.env.sample \
  /etc/github-runner-listener/scaleset-listener.env
sudo "${EDITOR:-vi}" /etc/github-runner-listener/scaleset-listener.env
# Fill in GITHUB_CONFIG_URL, GITHUB_TOKEN, SCALE_SET_NAME.
# Verify it is 0600 and root-owned:
sudo stat -c '%a %U' /etc/github-runner-listener/scaleset-listener.env   # -> 600 root
```

## 4. Install, enable & start the unit

```sh
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/scaleset-listener.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/scaleset-listener.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now scaleset-listener.service

# Watch it come up (the token never appears in the logs):
journalctl -u scaleset-listener -f
```

`Restart=always` (with a 5s backoff) keeps the listener supervised across a
clean drain (SIGTERM cancels the context, in-flight jobs drain within
`TimeoutStopSec`) or a transient error, so the host is never left without a
listener.

## Verifying the unit file

The unit is checkable without a live install:

```sh
systemd-analyze verify deploy/scaleset-listener.service
```

> **Live install is HITL.** Enabling the unit on a real host needs that host,
> a real scale set, and a valid admin token (none exist in CI). The unit file,
> the env sample, and these steps are the deliverable; the live
> enable/verify is performed by an operator on the target host.
